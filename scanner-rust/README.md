# Rust MEV Scanner

Production-oriented Rust arbitrage scanner for the repository's `FlashLoanArbitrage` Solidity contract.

## Features
- Bellman-Ford negative-cycle arbitrage detection
- Fee-aware edge weights (`-ln(price * (1 - fee))`) net of every per-hop DEX swap fee
- Live Arbitrum multi-DEX pool data feed (Uniswap V3 + SushiSwap) — Phase 3
- Canonical opportunity payloads matching the TypeScript contract
- Local `revm` simulation before execution
- Flashbots bundle submission flow
- Prometheus metrics and optional Supabase telemetry

## Quick start
```bash
cp .env.example .env
cargo build
cargo test
cargo run
```

## Live Arbitrum pool feed (Phase 3)
`scanner.fetch_pools()` pulls REAL, current pool state from Arbitrum mainnet:

- **Venues / fee tiers:** Uniswap V3 (500 / 3000 / 10000 ppm) and SushiSwap
  (UniswapV2-style, 3000 ppm), pools discovered via factory `getPool`/`getPair`.
- **Tokens:** WETH, USDC (native), USDC.e, USDT, ARB, WBTC, GMX, PENDLE, MAGIC,
  RDNT, DAI (canonical, verified Arbitrum addresses).
- **Prices:** Uniswap V3 from `slot0().sqrtPriceX96`
  (`(sqrt/2^96)^2 * 10^(dec0-dec1)`); V2 from `getReserves()`
  (`reserve1/reserve0 * 10^(dec0-dec1)`). Both directions are emitted with the
  correct per-direction price and the pool's fee.
- **Decimals:** USDC/USDC.e/USDT = 6, WBTC = 8, others = 18. A wrong decimal
  factor manufactures fake spreads, so implausible prices are logged and skipped.
- **Liquidity guard:** on-chain `balanceOf` reserves are valued in USD (stables
  anchored at $1, other tokens derived from the observed graph) and pools below
  `SCANNER_MIN_POOL_LIQUIDITY_USD` (default $5000) are skipped as dust.
- **RPC resilience:** batched `eth_call`s, a request timeout, retries with
  backoff, and modest sequential chunking for rate-limited free tiers.

Run a detection-only live dry run (no execution, no broadcast):
```bash
# key is read from the environment; it is never hardcoded or printed
export ALCHEMY_API_KEY=...   # or SCANNER_RPC_URL=https://...
cargo run --example sim_gate_scan
```

## Multi-hop pipeline (Phases 1–7)

The scanner pivoted from simple 2-DEX arbitrage (no fee-aware edge on liquid
pairs) to **multi-hop / triangular** arbitrage via a Bellman-Ford negative-cycle
scanner. The full chain is **detection + simulation + payload build ONLY** —
nothing signs, broadcasts, or flips a live flag; execution stays disabled.

```
live pools @ block N            (pools.rs, Phase 3 + Phase 8 cross-tick data)
  -> fee-aware Bellman-Ford      (scanner.rs, Phases 1–2)
  -> price-impact SIM gate       (sim.rs, Phase 4 + 8: V2 exact; V3 exact FULL
                                  cross-tick walk (bounded, fail-closed);
                                  realized net from the sim)
  -> build Hop[] payload         (payload.rs, Phase 6: per-hop amountOutMin = sim
                                  output - slippage)
  -> DRY-RUN validate            (payload.rs: hop count [2,5], nonzero router/
                                  tokenOut, per-hop min>0, loop closes to asset)
  -> ABI-encode executeArbitrage (flashlight.rs, Phase 5 contract)  -> STOP
```

`pipeline::run_sample` runs steps 2–6 over one snapshot and returns honest
per-stage metrics (edges loaded, USD-priceable coverage, cycles proposed,
survived, rejected_negative, rejected_unsimulable, and each survivor's route +
realized net + encoded calldata).

### V3 cross-tick swap simulation (Phase 8)
The V3 leg of the sim gate walks each swap **tick-by-tick**, exactly like the
real Uniswap V3 pool, instead of quoting only within the current tick-spacing
interval:

- **Exact integer math.** `get_sqrt_ratio_at_tick` (TickMath magic constants),
  `compute_swap_step` (SwapMath: amountIn rounded UP, amountOut rounded DOWN,
  per-step fee), and Q64.96 `getAmount0/1Delta` reproduce the on-chain result.
  A trade that stays inside one interval yields the **identical** output to the
  old within-interval math (asserted by an equivalence test).
- **Real liquidity crossings.** `pools.rs` fetches a bounded window of the pool's
  `tickBitmap(int16)` words around the current tick and each initialized tick's
  `ticks(int24).liquidityNet`. The loop applies `liquidityNet` to in-range `L`
  at every crossing (add moving up / subtract moving down), so multi-interval
  trades quote an exact (or provably conservative) output.
- **Bounded, fail-closed frontier (anti-mirage).** The walk is capped by the
  fetched tick window and `MAX_TICK_CROSSINGS`. Anything genuinely unknowable —
  no liquidity, missing/partial tick data, a degraded RPC batch, an unknown fee
  tier, overflow, or exceeding the crossing cap — returns `None` and the cycle is
  bucketed `rejected_unsimulable`. A pool without complete in-bounds cross-tick
  data simply falls back to the Phase-4 within-interval behaviour (which still
  fail-closes on a crossing). Rounding always biases toward **under**-stating
  output, never toward inventing profit.

The effect on the honest rejection buckets: cycles that Phase 4 rejected as
`rejected_unsimulable` *purely because* a V3 leg would cross a tick are now
simulated and either **survive** or are honestly `rejected_negative`;
`rejected_unsimulable` is reserved for truly unknowable states. Zero surviving
opportunities remains a valid, truthful outcome.

### Run the capstone dry run
The capstone example samples the whole pipeline across several live blocks, then
always runs a clearly-labeled **synthetic fixture** pass (works with no RPC):
```bash
# LIVE + SYNTHETIC. Key is read from env, never printed/committed. Set it INLINE
# in the same command (env vars don't persist across shells on Windows):
#   PowerShell:  $env:ALCHEMY_API_KEY='<key>'; cargo run --example multi_hop_pipeline
#   bash:        ALCHEMY_API_KEY=<key> cargo run --example multi_hop_pipeline
cargo run --example multi_hop_pipeline           # no RPC => LIVE pass auto-skips
```
Sampling and economics are env-tunable:
- `SCANNER_LIVE_SAMPLES` (default 3) — number of live block samples.
- `SCANNER_LIVE_SAMPLE_DELAY_SECS` (default 5) — delay between samples.
- `SCANNER_SIM_LOAN_SIZES_USD`, `SCANNER_SIM_GAS_USD_PER_HOP`,
  `SCANNER_DRYRUN_SLIPPAGE_BPS` — loan sweep, per-hop gas, slippage guard.

**ZERO surviving cycles is a valid, expected, honest outcome** — spot spreads on
liquid Arbitrum pairs are mirages that price impact erases. The pipeline never
weakens a gate to manufacture a survivor. `tests/pipeline_integration_tests.rs`
proves the whole path deterministically over a synthetic fixture (no RPC).

## Environment
Set at least one RPC URL and the matching contract address for live execution.
For the Arbitrum pool feed set one of `SCANNER_RPC_URL`, `ARBITRUM_RPC_URL`, or
`ALCHEMY_API_KEY` / `VITE_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` (see `.env.example`).

## Contract integration
`FlashlightEncoder::encode_execute_arbitrage` encodes
`executeArbitrage(address,uint256,(address,address,bool,uint24,uint256)[])`
(the Phase 5 N-hop `Hop[]` signature, selector `0xcfaa9316`) exactly as required
by `FlashLoanArbitrage.sol`.
