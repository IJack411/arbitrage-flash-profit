//! Phase 7: reusable end-to-end multi-hop pipeline orchestration.
//!
//! Phases 1–6 built each stage of the multi-hop arbitrage pipeline in its own
//! module. This module ties them into ONE reusable, synchronous pass so both the
//! capstone example (`examples/multi_hop_pipeline.rs`) and the deterministic
//! integration test (`tests/pipeline_integration_tests.rs`) drive the exact same
//! code path:
//!
//!   Bellman-Ford negative-cycle detection (`scanner`) ->
//!   per-hop price-impact SIMULATION gate (`sim`, loan-size sweep) ->
//!   `build_hops_from_cycle` (`payload`, sim-derived per-hop `amountOutMin`) ->
//!   `validate_execution_payload` (`payload`, fail-closed) ->
//!   `FlashlightEncoder::encode_execute_arbitrage` (`flashlight`, `Hop[]` calldata)
//!   -> STOP and record honest metrics.
//!
//! It REUSES the existing detector / simulator / validator / encoder — it never
//! reimplements swap math or validation. It is DETECTION + SIMULATION + PAYLOAD
//! BUILD ONLY: nothing here signs, broadcasts, approves, submits a Flashbots
//! bundle, sends a transaction, or flips a live flag. There is no reachable path
//! from this module to a transaction. Execution stays disabled.
//!
//! `run_sample` is deliberately pure and RPC-free: it takes an already-fetched
//! pool snapshot (edges + USD price map + optional block number) so it can be
//! exercised deterministically against a synthetic fixture with no network.
